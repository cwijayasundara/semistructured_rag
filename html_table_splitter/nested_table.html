Leonhard Euler was born on 15 April 1707, in Basel to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the Reformed Church, and Marguerite (née Brucker), whose ancestors include a number of well-known scholars in the classics.[16] He was the oldest of four children, having two younger sisters, Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena, and a younger brother, Johann Heinrich.[17][16] Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Euler family moved from Basel to the town of Riehen, Switzerland, where his father became pastor in the local church and Leonhard spent most of his childhood.[16]

From a young age, Euler received schooling in mathematics from his father, who had taken courses from Jacob Bernoulli some years earlier at the University of Basel. Around the age of eight, Euler was sent to live at his maternal grandmother's house and enrolled in the Latin school in Basel. In addition, he received private tutoring from Johannes Burckhardt, a young theologian with a keen interest in mathematics.[16]

In 1720, at thirteen years of age, Euler enrolled at the University of Basel.[7] Attending university at such a young age was not unusual at the time.[16] The course on elementary mathematics was given by Johann Bernoulli, the younger brother of the deceased Jacob Bernoulli (who had taught Euler's father). Johann Bernoulli and Euler soon got to know each other better. Euler described Bernoulli in his autobiography:[18]

"the famous professor Johann Bernoulli [...] made it a special pleasure for himself to help me along in the mathematical sciences. Private lessons, however, he refused because of his busy schedule. However, he gave me a far more salutary advice, which consisted in myself getting a hold of some of the more difficult mathematical books and working through them with great diligence, and should I encounter some objections or difficulties, he offered me free access to him every Saturday afternoon, and he was gracious enough to comment on the collected difficulties, which was done with such a desired advantage that, when he resolved one of my objections, ten others at once disappeared, which certainly is the best method of making happy progress in the mathematical sciences."
It was during this time that Euler, backed by Bernoulli, obtained his father's consent to become a mathematician instead of a pastor.[19][20]

In 1723, Euler received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of René Descartes and Isaac Newton.[16] Afterwards, he enrolled in the theological faculty of the University of Basel.[20]

In 1726, Euler completed a dissertation on the propagation of sound with the title De Sono[21][22] with which he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a position at the University of Basel.[23] In 1727, he entered the Paris Academy prize competition (offered annually and later biennially by the academy beginning in 1720)[24] for the first time. The problem posed that year was to find the best way to place the masts on a ship. Pierre Bouguer, who became known as "the father of naval architecture", won and Euler took second place.[25] Over the years, Euler entered this competition 15 times,[24] winning 12 of them.[25]

Career
Saint Petersburg

1957 Soviet Union stamp commemorating the 250th birthday of Euler. The text says: 250 years from the birth of the great mathematician, academician Leonhard Euler.
Johann Bernoulli's two sons, Daniel and Nicolaus, entered into service at the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg in 1725, leaving Euler with the assurance they would recommend him to a post when one was available.[23] On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of appendicitis after spending less than a year in Russia.[26][27] When Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler.[23] In November 1726, Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.[23]

Euler arrived in Saint Petersburg in May 1727.[23][20] He was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department. He lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he worked in close collaboration.[28] Euler mastered Russian, settled into life in Saint Petersburg and took on an additional job as a medic in the Russian Navy.[29]

The academy at Saint Petersburg, established by Peter the Great, was intended to improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe. As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler.[25] The academy's benefactress, Catherine I, who had continued the progressive policies of her late husband, died before Euler's arrival to Saint Petersburg.[30] The Russian conservative nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelve-year-old Peter II.[30] The nobility, suspicious of the academy's foreign scientists, cut funding for Euler and his colleagues and prevented the entrance of foreign and non-aristocratic students into the Gymnasium and universities.[30]

Conditions improved slightly after the death of Peter II in 1730 and the German-influenced Anna of Russia assumed power.[31] Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of physics in 1731.[31] He also left the Russian Navy, refusing a promotion to lieutenant.[31] Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics department.[32] In January 1734, he married Katharina Gsell (1707–1773), a daughter of Georg Gsell.[33] Frederick II had made an attempt to recruit the services of Euler for his newly established Berlin Academy in 1740, but Euler initially preferred to stay in St Petersburg.[34] But after Empress Anna died and Frederick II agreed to pay 1600 ecus (the same as Euler earned in Russia) he agreed to move to Berlin. In 1741, he requested permission to leave to Berlin, arguing he was in need of a milder climate for his eyesight.[34] The Russian academy gave its consent and would pay him 200 rubles per year as one of its active members.[34]</td>
